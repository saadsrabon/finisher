# **Finisher**

Finisher is an intuitive task management web app designed for individuals and teams to effectively create, manage, and track tasks. With a clean user interface and a variety of features, Finisher helps users stay organized and productive by streamlining task management.

## **Features**

### 1. **Task Creation**
   - Easily create new tasks by providing details such as:
     - **Title**: Name of the task.
     - **Description**: A brief overview or details of the task.
     - **Tags**: Add labels to categorize and filter tasks.
     - **Due Date**: Set deadlines to keep track of when tasks should be completed.
     - **Priority**: Assign priority levels (low, medium, high) to manage importance.
     - **Owner**: Specify who is responsible for completing the task.
     
   Finisher makes task creation seamless and efficient, ensuring that all necessary details are captured.

### 2. **Task Listing**
   - View a list of all created tasks with details such as title, due date, and priority at a glance. Tasks are neatly displayed for easy access and management.

### 3. **Search with Debounce**
   - Finisher includes a powerful search functionality that allows users to find tasks by entering keywords. To enhance the search experience, the app implements the 'debounce' technique, ensuring that the search triggers only after the user stops typing, resulting in better performance and more accurate results.

### 4. **Task Categorization**
   - Users can categorize tasks based on:
     - **Tags**: Filter tasks by specific labels.
     - **Priority**: Organize tasks by urgency.
     - **Owner**: View tasks based on the responsible person.
   This feature makes it easier to find and manage tasks depending on their characteristics.

### 5. **Mark Tasks as Favorite**
   - Users can mark important tasks as favorites for quick access, helping them stay focused on priority tasks.

### 6. **Task Status Tracking**
   - Finisher provides a clear overview of the current status of tasks, such as pending, in-progress, or completed. Users can easily update the status of tasks as they progress, allowing for better task management.

### 7. **Task Editing**
   - Edit any task to modify its details (e.g., title, description, due date, priority, tags, owner, etc.) when changes are needed. This ensures that tasks stay up-to-date.

### 8. **Task Deletion**
   - Easily delete one or more tasks when they are no longer needed, helping users keep their task list clean and manageable.
